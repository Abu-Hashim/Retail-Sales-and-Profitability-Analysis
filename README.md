# Retail-Sales-and-Profitability-Analysis
Project Overview:
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of retail transaction data to understand sales patterns, profitability, product performance, customer value, and regional trends.
Using Python and data visualization techniques, the project identifies key drivers of profit and areas causing losses, enabling data-driven business insights.

The analysis is performed on the Superstore retail dataset, a widely used dataset representing real-world retail operations.

# Objectives:
- Analyze monthly sales trends to identify seasonality
- Evaluate sales and profit performance at category and sub-category levels
- Identify top profitable and loss-making products
- Analyze regional sales performance
- Identify high-value customers
- Study the impact of discounting on profitability
- Understand relationships between key variables using correlation analysis

# Tools & Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas – data cleaning, preprocessing, aggregation
- NumPy – numerical operations
- Matplotlib – base visualization and formatting
- Seaborn – statistical and professional visualizations
- Google Colab – cloud-based development environment

# Dataset Information:
- Dataset: Superstore Retail Dataset
- Records: ~9,994 rows
- Columns: 21
- Key Features: Sales, Profit, Discount, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category, Product, Customer, Region, Order Date, Ship Date
- The dataset contains transactional retail data covering multiple product categories, customers, and geographic regions.

# Analysis Performed:
- The following analyses and visualizations were created:
- Monthly Sales Trend – Line chart to analyze sales seasonality
- Category-wise Sales vs Profit – Comparison of revenue and profitability
- Sub-Category Sales vs Profit – Detailed product-level performance
- Top 10 Most Profitable Products
- Top 10 Least Profitable (Loss-Making) Products
- Region-wise Sales Analysis
- Top 10 Most Valuable Customers by Sales
- Discount vs Profit Relationship – Scatter plot with trend line
- Correlation Heatmap – Relationship between Sales, Profit, Discount, and Quantity
- All charts follow a consistent EDA structure:
- Objective
- Observation
- Insight / Interpretation

# Key Insights:
- Sales show clear seasonal trends, with higher performance in year-end months
- Technology is the most profitable category
- Furniture generates high sales but low or negative profit
- Certain sub-categories (e.g., Tables, Bookcases) are major loss contributors
- A small group of customers contributes a significant portion of total sales
- Higher discounts strongly reduce profitability
- Discount has the strongest negative correlation with profit

# Business Recommendations:
- Review and optimize discount strategies
- Re-evaluate pricing for loss-making products
- Focus marketing efforts on high-margin products
- Strengthen customer retention for high-value customers
- Improve performance in underperforming regions

# How to Run the Project:
- Open the notebook in Google Colab
- Upload the dataset (Sample - Superstore.csv)
- Run all cells sequentially
- Visualizations and insights will be generated automatically
